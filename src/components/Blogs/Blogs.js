                <p className="">The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.Thatâ€™s one of the best concepts about React - you can create a bunch of components and have a fully maintainable and concise application, without having to create a super huge component to deal with your whole application.</p>
